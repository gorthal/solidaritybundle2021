# A CHARITY ACTION POWERED BY OUR IMAGINATIONS
Call to publishers and authors from around the world on itch.io for Doctors Without Borders

The crisis of COVID continues to increase inequalities around the world with a brutality that is further reinforced by the many conflicts and distress situations that affect the poorest. We must all feel concerned.

We are calling for game creators from around the world to organize a fundraiser in November 2021 for Doctors Without Borders. **Doctors Without Borders (https://www.doctorswithoutborders.org/)** is an international medical humanitarian organization that works in 70 countries to help people whose lives or health are threatened. 

This operation starts today on itch.io and will end **on Sunday, November 28, 2021**.

## How to participate? 
You are a professional or amateur game author or editor and you are interested in this charity action?  You just have to publish your contribution on the itch.io website and join the Solidarity Bundle at this address : XXXX (address to come!)

We are open to all games that stimulate our imaginations: role-playing games, LARP, game books, interactive fictions, multiple choice poems, lyrical games, ritual games, ...

## A charity action within the framework of the CYBERCONV 3
The CyberConv is a French-speaking role-playing convention which offers many animations accessible directly with a computer and internet: role-playing games, a live livestream during the whole convention, round tables, virtual booths to present actors of the role-playing world, a game creation contest and more...  

Previous editions were held in 2020 in April and November. These events resulted in over 100 hours of livestreams, a dedicated Discord server with 4,000 enthusiasts in 200 chat rooms, 300 gaming sessions and 25 panels with 100 participants.  We're back this fall for a third edition to continue playing, sharing and exchanging our passion for tabletop roleplaying. The next CyberCon will be held on November 27 and 28, 2021 with a similar offer.  

In 2020 we organized 2 fundraising events for Secours Populaire, MSF and Handicap International. More than **26,000 € were collected in 2020** and donors received more than 150 roleplaying games in digital format.
