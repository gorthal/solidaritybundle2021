## What is CyberConv?
**An online tabletop RPG convention**  
CyberConv is a fench tabletop RPG convention which offers numerous activities to access online: tabletop RPG sessions, a livestream running continuously during its whole duration, panels, virtual booths showcasing worldwide game designers, a game creation jam contest and much more.
Our previous editions were held in 2020 in April and November. This event saw more than 100 hours of livestream, a dedicated Discord server gathering 4,000 enthusiasts across 200 chatrooms, 300 game sessions and 25 panels gathering 100 participants.  
We are back this fall for a third edition to keep on gaming, share and exchange our passion for tabletop roleplaying. The next CyberCon will be held on November 27th to 28th 2021 with a similar offer.

## A call for a third solidarity bundle
As part of the previous CyberConv we brought together a tabletop RPG bundle as a fundraising initiative towards several associations of public utility. More than **â‚¬26,000 were raised in 2020** while donors were awarded a collection of digital tabletop RPG (PDF format).  
For the 2021 edition of CyberConv, the organisers are renewing this fundraising action. The 2020 editions have hosted mainly French-speaking games. This time we are opening our action even more widely by welcoming authors from all over the world.  
All donations will be donated to , an international medical humanitarian association that works in 70 countries to provide assistance to populations whose lives or health are threatened. This includes conflicts, epidemics and natural disasters.  
The operation will start on **Monday 1 November** and end on **Sunday 28 November**.

All game publishers and designers are welcome: whether you have an online store, a brickand- mortar business or an independent publisher, we sincerely wish you to join this initiative.
